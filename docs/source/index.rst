Welcome to WEAS Widget's documentation!
===========================================
A widget to visualize and interact with atomic structures in Jupyter Notebook. It uses WEAS_ (Web Environment For Atomistic Structure) in the backend.
You can also control the widget through LLM agents (e.g., LangChain) for guided edits and analysis.


.. note::

   If you encounter any problems, please update the widget to the latest version. If the problem persists, please report it on the `GitHub issue <https://github.com/superstar54/weas-widget/issues>`_
